Refer to this code: https://github.com/raghakot/keras-resnet

This is the starting code. You are training ResNet 50

Sticking to ResNet architecture as defined in the code above will give you 500 points (if you clear the cut-off), else you are free to define any architecture of your choice.

You need to change the dataset from Cifar10 to Tiny-ImageNet https://www.kaggle.com/c/tiny-imagenet/data  (Links to an external site.)

in the case above link is not working for you use this direct dataset link: http://cs231n.stanford.edu/tiny-imagenet-200.zip  (Links to an external site.)
or GOOGLEDRIVELINK (Links to an external site.)
You are free to use any optimizer.

You MUST perform image augmentation (at least 5 out of 10 variants).

You need to get a Validation Score of +70%

You cannot use more than 500 Epochs

You cannot have more than 26M parameters

The assignment default weightage is 2000 pts (if you beat 70% target). For each 0.1% improvement, you get 100 point (i.e. 72% = 4000 pts).

You cannot use:

1x1 for an increasing number of channels
dropout
fully connected layers
test images in training the data (this will give you -7000 points)
anything else than Google Colab (using anything else would result in -7000 points)
already trained model, (this will give you -7000 points)
